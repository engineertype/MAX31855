This is the GitHub source code repository for the Arduino MAX31855 library and example code for Arduino.

Maxim has released a newer version of this IC called MAX31856.  You can find the library here:
https://github.com/engineertype/MAX31856

This library offers advantages over other MAX31855 libraries:
a. Returns both the junction (IC) and thermocouple temperatures
b. Handles negative temperatures
c. Returns thermocouple error codes, like open, short-to-ground and short-to-vcc
d. Returns an error if the MAX31855 isn’t communicating (wiring issue?)
